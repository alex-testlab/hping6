This is regular hping2 with a few extra features:

* `-6` - required for ipv6 destinations
* `--pps`
* `--bps` - set outgoing pps/bps rates. Return packets are not processed in these modes.
* `-flood`-send packets as soon as posible.
* random source ip and dest ip support ipv6

Example:

    root@koszik-vps:~# ./hping6 ns1.atw.hu -6 -2 -p 53 -k  -s 1583 --traceroute
    HPING ns1.atw.hu (eth0 2a01:270:0:2::11): udp mode set, 48 headers + 0 data bytes

TCP flood attack with random source ip with ipv6:

    root@testlab:~# ./hping6 2022:1:1:1::2 -6 --rand-source --flood

    `2022:1:1:1::2` is the ipv6 address you want to attack
